#📘 Linear System Solver

A lightweight C++ project for solving systems of linear equations using numerical and algebraic methods.
This project aims to provide both an educational implementation (step-by-step Gaussian elimination) and a high-performance solver (using libraries like Eigen).
Later, the project will expand with a Python implementation for symbolic algebra and web integration.

#🚀 Features

Solve linear systems of equations 

Detect cases:

✅ Unique solution

♾️ Infinite solutions

❌ No solution

Gaussian elimination (manual implementation)

(Planned) LU decomposition for efficiency

(Planned) Python version with SymPy for symbolic solving

(Planned) Web UI to input equations and see solutions

🛠️ Tech Stack
Current (C++)

C++17 (core language)

Eigen
 (optional, for matrix operations)

Future (Python)

Python 3.12+

NumPy (fast linear algebra)

SymPy (symbolic math, step-by-step solving)

Flask / FastAPI (for API support)

#✅ Roadmap

 Implement Gaussian elimination (C++)

 Add determinant-based solver (Cramer’s Rule)

 Add Eigen integration for larger systems

 Port solver to Python (NumPy + SymPy)

 Build API with FastAPI (Python)

 Create Web UI for solving equations
